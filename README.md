# **69-Day DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Plan**

## **Overview**
This repository provides a structured 69-day plan to help you master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It is designed for individuals preparing for coding interviews or anyone looking to improve their problem-solving skills. The plan covers fundamental to advanced topics, broken down into manageable daily tasks. 

By following this plan, youâ€™ll not only learn key data structures and algorithms but also practice solving real-world problems, ensuring youâ€™re well-prepared for coding challenges.

## **How to Use This Plan**
1. **Commitment**: Dedicate time each day to study the theory, implement examples, and solve problems.
2. **Track Progress**: Use a personal tracker to mark completed tasks and monitor your growth.
3. **Practice Platforms**: Solve problems on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).
4. **Review and Revise**: If you find a topic challenging, revisit it during the review days.

## **Phases Overview**
The plan is divided into four phases:
- **Phase 1: Foundations (Days 1-10)**
- **Phase 2: Core Data Structures (Days 11-30)**
- **Phase 3: Advanced Algorithms (Days 31-50)**
- **Phase 4: Problem-Solving and Optimization (Days 51-69)**
